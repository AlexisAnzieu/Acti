        Let's rewind to Day 0, when on Tuesday, May 29th, in the late afternoon,
        we began our railway adventure. We needed to get to Toronto to board the
        Trans-Canadian. No problem, we had already made the five-hour journey
        from Montreal to Toronto several times. The recently commissioned
        comfortable carriages allowed us to enjoy a beautiful sunset. The only
        downside was the untimely horn blasts that occurred at every small
        intersection lacking signal barriers. With noise-canceling headphones on
        and pocket book in hand, we got a taste of our upcoming adventure.

        Our arrival in Toronto began with a 15-minute night walk to the nearest

        to its time-worn armchairs. The filter coffee dispenser available
        doesn't really impress us. We decide to search for a Starbucks, hoping
        to blend a touch of the present with these vestiges of the past.

        "10 minutes before departure!" booms a deep voice through the station.
        We enjoy one last breath of fresh air as if we were boarding a spaceship
        for a year, then climb the access step leading to the car. This isn't
        just a door we're crossing but a genuine time machine. One step inside
        is enough to transport us 70 years back, to an era when carpet on walls
        was fashionable. Our car attendant shows us the room where we'll be
        sleeping for the next four days. Two seats are arranged here, to be
        folded away in the evening to make way for a bunk bed. The smell of old
        leather rises to our nostrils, accompanied by this nostalgia for a past
        we'd only seen in old movies.

        The train conductor welcomes us aboard over the loudspeakers, two
        minutes before engaging the speed lever. The acceleration is immediate.
        The landscape rushes by at full speed. Or almost. Our exit from
        Toronto's periphery begins at a blazing 20 km/h.

        We're so excited to explore the train that we leave our cocoon within 5
        minutes of departure. I felt like I was in an Agatha Christie novel,
        hoping the murder wouldn't involve any of us. If needed, we had bought
        an escape game along the way to satisfy our thirst for mystery (and also
        to keep us occupied). The first car we encounter, and by far the most
        important, is the dining car. Plates tinkle to the rhythm of the rails'
        jolts, offering us a sweet melody. We move up one more car and find
        ourselves in the activities car. A few board games with dilapidated
        cardboard boxes, victims of their success, pile up in a corner of the
        table. A lady calls out to me from the far end and asks if I'd like to
        taste the welcome mimosa cocktail. It's 10 AM but why not. This first
        morning consisted of getting acquainted with this kilometer-long
        vehicle, and we spent the following hours wandering from economy front
        to prestige rear. For the movie buffs among you, some might imagine this
        train like the one in Snowpiercer, symbolizing a class struggle. Here
        defined by access rights to the panoramic cars, the highlight of the
        show which we'll come back to later.

        for lunch. Here comes the time for double dating with strangers. The
        idea on board is to mix passengers from all horizons during meals. Two
        retirees tell us about their former architect professions: landscape
        designer in parks for one and in cemeteries for the other. This
        initially confused and awkward discussion gradually becomes clearer
        despite the language differences and generational gap. Though formal, it
        projects us into a different universe. But the exercise of translating
        to English is tiring, especially with the train noise and accents.

        At 5 PM, first stop in the middle of nowhere, it's barely 10 degrees but
