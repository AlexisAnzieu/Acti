        Discussions in the hallway wake us up. We had a good night's sleep,
        despite some agitated jolts. The mechanical iron monster continued its
        slow progression westward while we were in Morpheus's arms. It also
        passed through a pocket of network coverage, letting our smartphones
        capture a dozen notifications from the civilization we had now left
        behind.

        Ten minutes after waking up, we're seated at our breakfast table. Here
        again, a menu with four options: carnivore, pescatarian, vegetarian, or
        even vegan. We eat without much appetite, our bodies not having burned
        yesterday's calories.

        Then, the day's pattern repeats: reading, lunch, recreational
        activities, dinner, and more reading. We're indeed going to run out of
        reading material before the end of the journey. Anticipating this
        possibility, I had downloaded some music production tutorials to dive
        back into. Maybe an album by the end of the month, only time will tell!
        At 11:30 AM, the train finally stops at a station and we're allowed to
        get off. The fresh air on our faces revitalizes us and makes us
        increasingly aware of the confinement experienced on this train. We
        observe passengers doing impromptu jogs and all sorts of stretches. In
        short, everyday things unthinkable on a train. Our journey back in time
        is intensified by spotting a group of Amish in the distance boarding the
        train. The whistle blows, the access steps rise, and here we go again
        for the fantastic ride.

        Next comes lunch, during which we again met two strangers. Two
        Australians working in the medical field: a mental health expert and an
        orthopedist. Although the conversation was somewhat laborious
        (Australian accent isn't easy), we remain interested in discovering the
        heterogeneity of other inhabitants of this train-village.

        We notice that the train passengers have already started forming small
        groups. They play cards together or drink beers. It seems everyone has
        deserted their cabins as the games cars are packed. Once our adventure

        We sense the curiosity of the many English-speaking sexagenarian
        passengers towards these two thirty-something French people. Being in
        the middle of the train, we rarely cross paths with individuals at the
        front and rear as they have their own games and restaurant cars. Like a
        city divided into neighborhoods.

        Time flies, and we're back to one of our flagship activities: dinner.
        This time, we meet the only person our age in our neighborhood. She's a
        young socio-politics student from the Czech Republic who spent several
        weeks on a farm in Abitibi. She's traveling alone and will meet her
        friends in Vancouver. A second head joins our heterogeneous group. A
        forty-something Indian working in real estate explains to us with some
        urgency that he desperately needs Internet. He hadn't understood that
        the stops only lasted a few minutes, far too short to use the Wi-Fi. We
        become aware of the freedom we have in being able to disconnect from the
        network without impact.

        During the conversation, he invites us to dinner at his home with his
        wife upon our arrival. We politely decline as his topics of discussion
        mainly revolved around profit and money. He even handed us his business
        card at the end of the meal.
